Zodiac Quiz
This is my zodiac quiz that was used to demonstrate the use of PHP and using it to generate a quiz.

Quiz questions are generated and graded dynamically using PHP arrays that can be changed. 
The use of PHP objects and functions are used throughout the quiz.
PHP sessions are also used to hold value of partially answered questions so that user does not have to restart entirely to complete 
the quiz.
