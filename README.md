Zodiac Quiz - 
This is my zodiac quiz which was part of an assignment that would demonstrate the use of PHP.

Quiz questions are generated and graded dynamically using PHP arrays. The use of PHP objects and functions are used throughout the quiz. PHP sessions are also used to hold the value of partially answered questions so that the user does not have to restart entirely to complete the quiz.
